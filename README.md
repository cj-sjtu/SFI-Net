## Spatial–Frequency Interaction Transformer Network for Skin Lesion Segmentation

This is the Pytorch/PytorchLightning implementation of the paper:

* Spatial–Frequency Interaction Transformer Network for Skin Lesion Segmentation.

## Results
|    Method     |  Dataset  |  DSC   |  OA   |  mIoU |
|:-------------:|:---------:|:-----:|:-----:|------:|
|  SFI-Net   |   ISIC2017   |   93.63   |   94.95   | 88.32 |
|  SFI-Net   |   ISIC2018   |   93.47   |   95.09   | 87.92 |
|  SFI-Net   |   PH2        |   96.59   | 97.01     | 93.42 |

Due to some random operations in the training stage, reproduced results (run once) are slightly different from the reported in paper.
